# Machine Learning in Real Estate

I tried to sum up everything I managed to learn while working on this project as comments in the file, and I tried my best to make it interesting and informative.

To use the model download the folder and run Real State Predictor.py file. The model has been saved as 'Real Estate Predictor.joblib'.
