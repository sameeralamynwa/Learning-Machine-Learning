# Machine Learning in Real Estate

I tried to sum up everything I managed to learn while working on this project as comments in the file, and I tried my best to make it interesting and informative.

To use the model download the folder and run Model Usage.pynb. The model has been saved as Real Estate Predictor.joblib.
